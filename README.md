# PCE
## Run with python

### Input
Input includes two main parts: Network Topology and Connections\
\
Both input json file is stored under `./tests/data`
#### Network Topology
%The connection will be a list of list stored in /test/data/connection.json.
\
The Network Topology should be generated in the format of NetworkX graph. For each link, three attributes need to be assigned: cost, bandwidth and latency. The current unit of each attribute is abstract, but the unit in the Network Topology should be consistent with the unit in Connections.\
\
Currently, the graph is randomly generated by using NetworkX and all the attributes are randomly assigned based on the users setting. 
#### Connection
The connection will be a list of list stored in `./tests/data/connection.json`. \
\
The format of the input connection is `[Source node, Destination node, Bandwidth required, Latency required]`.  \
Here is an example of a random connection.json:
```
[[1,10,8,20],[2,9,10,15],[15,10,6,22]]
```
There are three queries in this connection.json, the first one is `[1,10,15,20]`.\
It means this connection query is to route traffic from Node 1 to Node 10, requring a bandwith of 8 and maximum latency of 20.\
\
For testing, a random connection generator is located at `Utility/RandomConnectionGen.py`. It can randomly generate one or multiple queries in one connection.json.

### Connection Generation (use bullet just for random generation)
Random connection generator is located at Utility/RandomConnectionGen.py. 
```
RandomConnectionGenerator(nodes, querynum, bw, latencylimit)
```
This will randomly generate one or multiple queries in one connection.json stored in `tests/data/connection.json`. 
### Where to Input
Connection is called at the beginning of lbnxgraphgenerator() using GetConnection() in `/LoadBalancing/RandomTopologyGenerator`
\

g will be the input NetworkX format topology. The current random topology is get from GetNetworkToplogy() .

### Output
To get the optimal path and related objective value:
#### MC_Solver (how I split the function and call the input)
For Minimizing the total path cost, do `from LoadBalancing.MC_Solver import runMC_Solver`:
```
runMC_Solver()
```
This will output a tuple of 2 elements: (Path List Dict, Total Cost).\
For example, using the previous connection.json, the output will be:
```
({1: [[1, 13], [13, 19], [19, 8], [8, 2], [2, 10]], 2: [[2, 10], [10, 9]], 3: [[15, 10]]}, 27401516.0)
```
The first element is a dict which has the connection# as key and path list as value, for the first connection, the traffic will be routed from Node 1 to Node 10, the path will be 1->13->19->8->2->10, and the total cost for applying all the three connections will be 27401516 in total.\

#### LB_Solver
For Minimizing the total path utilization, do `from LoadBalancing.LB_Utilization_Solver import runLB_UT_Solver`:
```
runLB_UT_Solver()
```
This will output a tuple of 2 elements: (Path List Dict, Total Utilization).\
Still using the previous connection.json, this time output will be:
```
({1: [[1, 14], [14, 10]], 2: [[2, 9]], 3: [[15, 10]]}, 0.08040263457045238)
```
The first element is same as in MC_Solver, but the second element will be the total utilization of all links which is around 0.08.


## Environment Setup and Install

The network topology is generated by NetworkX and the traffic matrix computation is executed by Google OrTools Solver. 

You might want to check out the source code and install it in a
virtual environment, like so:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/atlanticwave-sdx/pce.git
$ cd pce
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ python3 -m pip install -e .
```

Note that we will need a recent version of pip for "editable" mode to
work, which is why there's a step where we upgrade pip.  It is a good
idea anyway.


### Building packages

You can build source and wheel packages using
[build](https://pypi.org/project/build/)))):

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install build
$ python3 -m build
```

Resulting source and wheel archives will be in `dist` directory.


### Running tests

Once you have the source code checked out and a virtual environment
set up as shown above, you can run the unit tests like so:


```shell
$ python3 -m pip install -e .[test]
$ python3 -m unittest
```

You can also run individual unit tests, like so:

```shell
$ python3 -m unittest -v tests.LoadBalancing.test_LB_Solver
$ python3 -m unittest -v tests.LoadBalancing.test_MC_Solver
```

Also, every data file was stored in test/data as json file. Remember to change the path according to local directory.
